Summary: The one-stop bundle for all the resources for 4 years B.Sc. CSIT study.

> Warning: This is a challenging task. DMCA might take down some repo. Let's see.

The main problem I faced while studying CSIT was that I had to stumble upon networks of hyperlinks to find the exact resource or course material that I needed to do my assignments/reports. Whenever I find something interesting or something that I need, I immediately downloaded that. And that resulted a vast collection of the resource that might be helpful for the students who are studying B.Sc. CSIT.

To distribute these resources, I tried zipping the folder and uploading to GitHub, but GitHub didn't accept files more than 100MiB. Hence, I had to upload each folder separately. In Order to do that I created a GitHub organization called [CSIT-GUIDE].

All these repositories inside [CSIT-GUIDE] has subject wise notes, books, guides, question papers, lab works and other resources. All these were collected by me on 4 years of studying B.Sc. CSIT. I'm just trying to help all other students who are studying CSIT course.

The organization [CSIT-GUIDE] has eight repositories which are (semester wise) .

** NOTE: These repositories has the subjects that I was taught. The elective courses I was taught might not be taught to you. **

If you find anything missing, or you have some extra notes, you can always contribute.

You can contribute by:

1. Forking the repo you want to contribute.
2. Adding your resource and pushing to your forked repo.
3. Sending a new pull request.
