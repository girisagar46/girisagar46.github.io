Summary: I transferred my domain to cloudflare

The domain `sagargiri.com` was registered with `namecheap.com` and I was using `namecheap.com`'s nameservers to manage the domain.
I decided to transfer the domain to `cloudflare.com` for better security and performance.

I followed the steps mentioned in this  YouTube Video

Following above steps to the tee, I successfully transferred the domain to `cloudflare.com`.
